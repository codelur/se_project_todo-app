## Project Description

The **Simple Todo App** is a lightweight web application that allows users to manage their to-do tasks efficiently. It enables users to create, track, and remove tasks, providing an intuitive interface to organize their daily tasks with optional due dates. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a clean and responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Add New Task**: Users can create new tasks by providing a description and an optional due date.
- **Mark as Completed**: Each task has a checkbox allowing the user to mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Task**: Each task comes with a delete button to remove it from the list.
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each task is assigned a unique identifier for efficient event handling and differentiation.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Tasks are dynamically added, marked as complete, or deleted without needing to refresh the page.

## Functionalities

1. **Add Task**: Users can type a task description and (optionally) a due date into the input field and add it to the task list by clicking an "Add" button.
2. **View Tasks**: All tasks (active and completed) are displayed in a list format.
3. **Mark as Complete**: Users can check a checkbox to mark a task as completed. Completed tasks will visually indicate that they're done.
4. **Delete Task**: Users can remove a task by clicking the delete button next to each task.
5. **Unique Identifiers**: Each task created gets a unique ID to differentiate tasks for event handling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page, including the task input form and task list.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, making it visually appealing and responsive to different device sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality, including adding, marking, and deleting tasks, as well as handling the unique IDs for each task.

## How to Use

1. **Adding a New Task**: Enter the task description in the input box. Optionally, enter a due date. Then click the "Add Task" button. The task will appear in the task list.
2. **Marking a Task as Completed**: Check the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed. This will visually indicate that the task is done.
3. **Deleting a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.
4. **Viewing Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in the order they were added. Completed tasks will remain in the list unless deleted.
